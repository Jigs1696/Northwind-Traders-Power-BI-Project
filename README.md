# Northwind-Traders-Power-BI-Project
Hello Everyone ,

I am happy to share my submission for the #mavennorthwindchallenge conducted by Maven Analytics.

For this challenge, I worked as a BI Developer for Northwind Traders, a global import and export company that specializes in supplying high-quality gourmet food products to restaurants, cafes, and specialty food retailers around the world.

As part of my role, I have built a top-level interactive dashboard for the executive team using Power BI. Its purpose is to allow executive team to quickly understand the company's performance in key areas, including:

▶ Sales trends

▶ Product performance

▶ Key customers

▶ Shipping costs

The dashboard was created using data from Northwind Traders’ Sales, Products, and Customer databases. The dashboard included interactive charts and graphs that allowed the executive team to quickly analyze the data and identify trends. Additionally, I implemented filters to allow the executive team to drill down into the data and view the performance of

Sales, Orders, Quantity, Customer &Employees ,Fright.

I have implemented buttons to navigate between the report pages. I have also included one clear all button in all pages to clear all filters of the page in one go. I have used conditional formatting and tool tips to tell the insights.
